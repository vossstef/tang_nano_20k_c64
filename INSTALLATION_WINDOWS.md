# Installation using a Windows PC

This document explains how to install all the necessary files on the
Tang Nano 20K and the M0S Dock in order to use it as a C64 Nano
device.

This has been tested on Windows 11. It should work on older versions too.

Software needed:

  - [Gowin V1.9.11.01](https://www.gowinsemi.com/en/support/home/) **to synthesize the core**
  - [Gowin V1.9.11.02](https://www.gowinsemi.com/en/support/home/) **to program the flash of the TANG FPGA**
  - [BouffaloLabDevCube](https://dev.bouffalolab.com/download) **to flash the BL616**
  - [Latest release](https://github.com/vossstef/tang_nano_20k_c64/releases/latest) of C64Nano **FPGA** bitstream
  - [Latest release](http://github.com/harbaum/FPGA-Companion) of FPGA-Companion **BL616 µC firmware** (if not otherwise stated in the release note)
  - [Latest release](https://dl.sipeed.com/shareURL/TANG/Debugger/onboard/BL616) of the TANG onboard µC bl616 programmer firmware

In order to use the SD card for disks:

  - C64 disk images in .D64 or .G64 format
  - Cartridge images in .CRT format
  - BASIC Program files in .PRG format
  - Tape images in .TAP format
  - C64 Kernal files (8K) in .BIN format
  - SID Filter curve in .FLT format

# Flashing the Tang Nano 20k

First download the Gowin IDE. The Education version is sufficient and
won't need a licence.

Install the IDE on your system (follow the installation instructions
from Gowin).  After the Installation you should have it as an shortcut
on your desktop or in your start menu.

 - Press the ```S2``` button on the Tang Nano 20K and keep it pressed
 - Connect the Tang Nano 20k to the USB on your computer. You should hear the connecting sound of Windows.
 - Release the ```S2``` button

> [!CAUTION]
A FLASH programm attempt without keeping the board in reset may lead to corruption of the C1541 DOS images stored in FLASH requiring re-programming.

 - Start Gowin. **You should see the following screen**

Explanation: The C64Nano core makes use of the flash memory of the
Tang Nano 20k to store c1541 DOS ROMs. This may interfere with the FPGA
flash process. Pressing the ```S2``` during power up will prevent the
Tang Nano 20k from booting into the C64Nano core and will make sure
the flash ROM can be updated.

Now press on the “programmer” marked red on the picture above. **You
should see following screen:**

![](https://github.com/vossstef/tang_nano_20k_c64/blob/main/.assets/device.png)

-   Press save on the dialog
-   From there you can add a device for programming by pressing on the little
    icon with the green plus
-   At least three files have to be flashed:
    - The core itself: ```tang_nano_20k_c64.fs```
    - Two c1541 DOS ROMs
-   Than you can choose from the drop downs the parameter you see on the
    pictures.

**Important**:

  - ```tang_nano_20k_c64.fs``` is written to address 0x000000
  - ```reserved for Atari ST ROM``` address 0x100000
  - ```c1541 DOS Dolphin 2``` is written to address 0x200000
  - ```c1541 DOS CBM``` is written to address 0x20C000

Optionally two additional DOS ROMs may be flashed to the alternate
addresses:

  - ```c1541 DOS Speeddos Plus``` is written to address 0x214000
  - ```c1541 DOS Jiffy``` is written to address 0x21C000

These DOS for the c1541 emulation can later be selected from the on-screen-display (OSD).
  - For the FS file please choose the ```tang_nano_20k_c64.fs``` you just downloaded
  - User Code and IDCODE can be ignored
  - Mark each of your configs and press the little icon with the green play
    button. You should see a progress bar and then:

**That´s it for the Tang Nano 20k**

## Flashing the BL616 µC

For the BL616 you have to extract and start the BuffaloLabDevCube. 

**If you use the internal BL616 present on the Tang Nano 20K you loose
your possibility to flash the Tang over the USB connection.** It is thus
strongly recommended to use an external BL616 (e.g. a M0S Dock).

However, when using the internal BL616 you will be able to flash the
[original firmware](https://github.com/harbaum/MiSTeryNano/blob/main/bl616/friend_20k)
to the internal BL616 again to restore the flasher functionality of
the Tang Nano 20K. Using an external M0S is nevertheless recommended.

-   Press the ```BOOT``` button on your M0S Dock before you plug the USB connection
    on your PC. You should hear the hardware detecting sound.
-   Start the BuffaloLabDevCube from the directory where you decompressed it it
    ask you what chip should be used. Select BL616/BL618 and press “finish”

![](https://github.com/vossstef/tang_nano_20k_c64/blob/main/.assets/buffstart.png)

- You'll now see the program screen. On the right it should auto detect your
  device with a COM port. If not take a look in the device manager to check for
  the correct device detection.
- On the top click on MCU and browse to the firmware image file named
  ```misterynano_fw_bl616.bin``` (contains a unified firmware both for all cores)
- Choose “Open Uart” and than press “Create & Download”. The firmware should now be
  flashed

## Prepare the SD card

Format the SD card in FAT32. Copy your D64 / G64 / CRT / PRG / BIN / FLT files files on
it. You can organize your files in subdirectories. These files can later
be selected using the on-screen-display (OSD).
Default Mountpoints:  
Copy a *.D64 Disk image to your sdcard and rename it to disk8.d64 as default c1541 boot image.  
Copy a *.CRT ROM image to your sdcard and rename it to c64crt.crt as default Cartridge boot image.  
Copy a *.PRG BASIC file to your sdcard and rename it to c64prg.prg as default Program boot image.  
Copy a *.TAP Type image to your sdcard and rename it to c64tap.tap as default tape boot image. 
Copy a 8k Byte C64 Kernal ROM file *.BIN to your sdcard and rename it to c64kernal.bin as default Kernal boot image.<br>
Copy a *.FLT sid filter curve to your sdcard and rename it to c64flt.flt as default filter boot image.<br>

That´s it for now. Have fun using the C64Nano
